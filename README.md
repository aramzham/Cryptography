# Cryptography

This a cryptography example on how a sample text can be encrypted and decrypted securely using `DesEncryption` class.
The app can be used on numerous purposes (defence, message encryption etc.).

Cryptography is also used to check if the file is the **original** one or it has been changed in the process.
Take a look how it works by following [link](https://github.com/aramzham/Cryptography/tree/master/Cryptologie/Originality).

A little demonstration of cryptography on Windows Forms:

The elegant app has libraries that allow you to make your encryption using `DESCryptoServiceProvider` or `HMAC` with their numerous specificities.
